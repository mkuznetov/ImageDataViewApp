# ImageDataViewApp

A simple demo of the DataView usage in the ExtJS universal application.

Assuming the app is running locally on port 1841, switching between the toolkits
(classic/modern) can be done this way:

### http://localhost/?classic

or

### http://localhost/?modern

The main view of the application otputs several images with corresponding labels (everything in vertical layout).

Also, an app is available as static HTML page:

### <Application_Root_Folder>/index-test.html
